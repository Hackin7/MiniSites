# MiniSites
MiniSites is going to be a collection of small, simple website projects
Preferably, they would be made out of pure HTML, CSS and Javascript

So, what's going to be up here?
1. My freeCodeCamp projects (also on codepen.io)
2. Some smaller projects
3. Maybe some educational sites?

Some ideas are
1. Mini Text Editor
2. REST Client
and more small websites

Why not just put everything on codepen?

Codepen's organisation is messy to say the least for me. 
This is an attempt to organise some of those projects
